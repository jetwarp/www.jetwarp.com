    <h2>JetWarp</h2>
    <p>JetWarp provides a virtual tour of the property to prospective buyers. People can access JetWarp tours from their desktops or mobile devices. For the fully immersive experience, they need only to connect their device to a VR accessory like Google Cardboard. Using JetWarp, prospective buyers can go through all of the rooms at their own pace interacting with elements of the environment, and making the crucial decision of whether they want to make the trip in person. By giving propsective buyers an in person experience, JetWarp helps save both buyers' and agents' time and energy that is often wasted in showing properties that don't really interest the buyer.</p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>The process is easy. JetWarp sends in a service provider to capture images of the property. This involves taking a series of pictures with a 360-monopod mounted camera. These pictures are uploaded into the JetWarp system. At that point, extra information can be added like interactive panels that can provide more information about things like construction, appliances, and special characteristics of the property. All the seller or agent has to do is link to the JetWarp hosted tour. While this is very much like the video tours that are already being used, the immersive and interactive experience gives the prospective buyer a better chance to engage. With the appropriate equipment, regular sellers and agents can also provide images to JetWarp based on the <a href="specifications.html">system specifications.</a></p>

    <h2>Being There</h2>
    <p>People can take JetWarp tours on their desktops or laptops, but the best experience can be had using VR. With an inexpensive accessory nearly any smartphone can be converted into a simple virtual reality device. By experiencing the tours through virtual reality prospective buyers can get the feeling of walking through the property and interacting with it. Unlike video tours, JetWarp tours allow people to move through the property at their own pace. Further, sellers and agents can choose to add informational icons throughout the property that can help propsective buyers learn more about the property as they choose. By being able to move through the property and interact with it, people are more likely to connect and become engaged. <a href="samples.html">Check it out!</a></p>
