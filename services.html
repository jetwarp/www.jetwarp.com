People can access JetWarp tours from their desktops or mobile devices.
For the fully immersive experience, they need only to connect their
device to a VR accessory like Google Cardboard. Using JetWarp,
prospective buyers can go through all of the rooms at their own pace
interacting with elements of the environment, and making the crucial
decision of whether they want to make the trip in person. By giving
propsective buyers an in person experience, JetWarp helps save both
buyers' and agents' time and energy that is often wasted in showing
properties that don't really interest the buyer.</p></div></section><section class="pleat"><div class="summary"><h2>The Process</h2><p>The process is easy. JetWarp sends in a service provider to capture
images of the property. This involves taking a series of pictures with
a 360-monopod mounted camera. These pictures are uploaded into the
JetWarp system. At that point, extra information can be added like
interactive panels that can provide more information about things like
construction, appliances, and special characteristics of the property.
All the seller or agent has to do is link to the JetWarp hosted tour.
While this is very much like the video tours that are already being
used, the immersive and interactive experience gives the prospective
buyer a better chance to engage. With the appropriate equipment,
regular sellers and agents can also provide images to JetWarp based on
the <a href="specifications.html">system specifications.</a></p></div></section><section class="pleat"><div class="summary"><h2>Being There</h2><p>People can take JetWarp tours on their desktops or laptops, but the
best experience can be had using VR. With an inexpensive accessory
nearly any smartphone can be converted into a simple virtual reality
device. By experiencing the tours through virtual reality prospective
buyers can get the feeling of walking through the property and
interacting with it. Unlike video tours, JetWarp tours allow people to
move through the property at their own pace. Further, sellers and
agents can choose to add informational icons throughout the property
that can help propsective buyers learn more about the property as they
choose. By being able to move through the property and interact with
it, people are more likely to connect and become engaged.

<em>all</em> clients a complete representative point-by-point tour
of your property, without limits or redundancies in the number of
points to be photographed. JetWarp always captures as many panoramas
as are needed to give online visitors the sense that they've fully
toured the grounds, and offers a 100% money-back satisfaction
guarantee.</p></div><div class="tier"><h3>Full Facility</h3><p>For large-scale properties, such as office buildings, our base
offering will include a series of detailed captures equivalent to a
fully-representative linear walkthrough of the facility's space.
However, at a more premium price point, JetWarp will remain on-site
past the base walkthrough, collecting and assembling material "off
the beaten path", to provide an experience that allows browsers to
view <em>all</em> of a facility's visible space.</p></div><div class="tier"><h3>Bulk Discounts</h3><p>For realtors who have a large portfolio of properties they wish to
exhibit through JetWarp, we offer volume discounts for clients
scheduling five or more consecutive shoots within three days of each
other, as well as on-call subscription plans for a flexible range of
properties each month.</p></div></div><a href="mailto:info@jetwarp.com" class="button-link">Contact us for pricing</a></section><section class="pleat"><div class="summary"><h2>Get more information</h2><p>If you have any questions about what JetWarp can do for you, don't
